### KYC for masternodes

#### OVERVIEW

To add a layer of KYC for masternodes in the current system and a sense of ownership amongst the masternodes hence tying such a cluster of masternodes to physical entity which can held accountable for its actions.

#### Design

We established a bidirectional connection between a candidate and its owner inorder to retrieve a candidate belonging to a specific owner & vice versa.

All the masternodes are recognized by the KYC of their owners and hence are considered as a single verified entity ( for eg. while voting for invalid KYC, only one vote is considered per such cluster )

The contract is very strict in handing out penalty for invalid KYC, it results loss of all funds invested in all of its candidates.

For eg. say A proposes condidates B,C,D by paying for its proposal cost.
If at a later stage if some predecided amount of owners ( investors ) vote that a KYC for a A is invalid then A & all of its candidates (B,C,D) will lose their position & all their funds will be lost ( will remain with contract wallet ).
